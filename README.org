* Making Org-mode Beautiful
** This theme is dedicated to my wife Shell
  Who—in her beauty, her love, and her love for beauty—has shown me
  that form can enhance function.
* Mission
  - Make org mode headlines easy to read.  In any theme.
  - Make it look more like a published book and/or desktop app, less
    like angry fruit salad.
  - Make it awesome to live in an org buffer.
* Usage
  Load this theme over top your existing theme, and you should be
  golden.  If you find any incompatibilities, let me know with what
  theme and I will try and fix it.

  When loading a whole new theme overtop, org-beautify-theme will
  still be active with the old theme.  Just unload org-beautify-theme
  and then reload it, and everything will be fine again.

  If you still get really ugly headlines, customize the
  ~org-beautify-theme-use-box-hack~ variable and set it to nil (false).
